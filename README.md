# The Center for Data 2 Health (CD2H)

## About
The CD2H supports a vibrant and evolving collaborative informatics ecosystem for the CTSA Program and beyond. The CD2H harnesses and expands an ecosystem for translational scientists to discover and share their software, data, and other research resources within the CTSA Program network. The CD2H also creates a social coding environment for translational science institutions, leveraging the community-driven DREAM challenges as a mechanism to stimulate innovation. Collaborative innovation also serves as a strong foundation to support mechanisms to facilitate training, engagement, scholarly dissemination, and impact in translational science.

## Website
https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/home

This site provides a conduit for the CTSA community to access CD2H resources and content, collaborate and exchange ideas with the translational informatics community through working groups and events, and promote and disseminate their own resources and initiatives.

## Website Redesign

CD2H is currently involved in a full redesign of its web site.  For current status on this project, see the Website Redesign project in the Project tab above.


## Funding
